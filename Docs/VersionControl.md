## Source Code Version Control Tools
### Introduction
* Source control is very important in maintaining a standardized working environment. Whether working in a team or alone making sure that the source code stays the same across all devices is important in order to keep the code working wherever it may be getting worked on. This includes keeping all of the dependencies in a usuable state so that the code does not randomly break due to a change in a dependency. Additionally using version control. allows for previous states of the code to be maintained, so that in case the code breaks an earlier working version may be implemented as a quick fix.

### Github
* This specific project uses **Github** to deal with all source control. There are many benefits in using Github for this purpose, including easy implementation from VSCode. Github can be used directly from the UI of VSCode, making it very easy to use and navigate. Additionally, Github actions provides a lot of utility in creating developement pipelines. For more information the Github docs can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en).
